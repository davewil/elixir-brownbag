useful mix (elixir build tool) commands I've discovered so far...
mix help
mix format - applies standard Elixir formatting to source
iex -S mix (iex.bat -S mix in PS) - loads project and all modules into IEx - can then interact with then in CLI
mix run - run is also default command
mix deps.get - installs any new Hex packages referenced - mix.exs is sort of like package.json
